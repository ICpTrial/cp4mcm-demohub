## Useful resources

There is a crowd-sourced repository of scripts that help you automate installing additional modules. 

You can find it here: [PartyROKS](https://github.ibm.com/joshisa/partyroks) 

Maintainer: Sanjey Joshi & RH Synergy Team

Another repository of useful scripts can be found here: [https://github.com/pirsoscom/mcm_install_roks](https://github.com/pirsoscom/mcm_install_roks)

Maintainer: Niklaus Hirt

WARNING: All the scripts were written/tested for Mac and Linux. If you run Windows workstation better use Linux VM for this task.

## Recommended sequence of steps:

Configure the required CLIs according to the page [Prerequisite - Install CLI tools](https://pages.github.ibm.com/demohub/cloudpak-mcm/labs/installcli/)

1. Clone the PartROKS repo to your local workstation.

2. Edit `00-variables` file to include the URL to your Cloud Pak instance.

3. Run scipt `01a-cp4mcm-roks-hardening-ssl-tls-everywhere.sh` which changes the self-signed certificates with Let's Encrypt ones. 

4. Run script `01b-cp4mcm-roks-hardening-cronjob-prometheus-mem-autotuner.sh` which configure autotuning of Prometheus service.

5. Run script `02-cp4mcm-roks-external-registry-setup.sh` if you plan to upload images to the internal OpenShift registry.

6. Run script `04-deploy-mcm-openldap-ROKS.sh` to install and configure OpenLDAP. You can edit script to modify the users & passwords configured by default

7. Run script `05-cp4mcm-roks-ansible-online-setup.sh` to install Ansible Tower. If the script fails during install (it happens) just run it again.

## Installing CloudForms

To showcase VM management capabilities of IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management you need to install CloudForms.

Follow the installation procedure here: [Getting started with CloudForms in IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-pak-multicloud-management?topic=cloud-pak-multicloud-management-cf-getting-started)

Be aware, that to demonstrate VM management you need to define CloudForms provider connections to some target environments - like AWS, Azure or Vmware, MSVMM or RHEV.
