## Lab Overview

IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management is the enterprise-grade multicloud management solution. This cloud-agnostic solution leverages open-source technology and your existing tools to provide an integrated dashboard to manage your environments and your applications where they need to reside - public, private, or edge - with choice of vendor cloud platform and consistent visibility, governance and automation.

Event Management installed along with Monitoring module of the Cloud Pak gives you the capability to automate management of incidents and events that are associated with resources and applications. You can visualize and manage multiple clusters, and consolidate the information from your monitoring systems to address problems. Events can indicate something that happened on an application, service, or another monitored object. All events that are related to a single application, or to a particular cluster, are correlated with an incident. Event Management can receive events from various monitoring sources, either on-premises or in the cloud.

In this lab, you are the leader of the Operations team, responsible for problem resolution. You define how your team is notified in the event of a failure and define a "runbook" guide of possible remediation steps.

In this tutorial, you will explore the following key capabilities:
- `Create a policy that automatically assigns incidents to alert over Slack`
- `Generate sample events to verify that your new policy works as expected`
- `Use the runbook suggested to the incident to resolve it`

***

## Prerequisite

- You need to provision your own copy of the CP4MCM 2.0 environment, start it and verify for correct startup (check [here](../../gettingstarted/)).

***

## Business Context

In a real-world environment, an operator isn't going to continually watch the overview screen, waiting for new events or failures. This is where the event management capability comes in, which not only notifies operators when failure conditions occur but can also provide automated and guided remediation of error events.

In this tutorial, you will log in to the Hub cluster to configure and use event management capabilities.

You will complete the following tasks:

-	Create Online Banking support group
- Configure Slack integration
- Define Event Policy
- Define Incident Policy
- Configure Ansible Tower
- Configure Runbook automation
- Test runbook automation

***

## Create Online Banking support group

In this exercise, your task is to configure event management for handling events related to the Online Banking application.

1. To start the lab, you should be in your Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management Web Console. If you are not, check [here](../gettingstarted/) how to open your console page.

  ![](images/2-cluster-mgmt-img.png)

2. Now, let's open the Monitoring module user inteface. Click the hamburger **Menu** and select **Monitor health -> Incidents**.

   ![](images/2020-10-02-12-09-36.png)

3. To effectively handle incidents at scale, they must be automatically dispatched to the right users for handling. The first step is to create a group for users who will be responsible for handling Online Banking related events and incidents.Click the **Administration** tab (1) and then **Users and groups** (2)

   ![](images/2020-10-02-13-29-30.png)
    
4. Notice that some users have already been defined. There are the users with ClusterAdministrator role that were automatically assigend **Operations lead** role in the Monitoring module. Before we create support group, let's start with adding a user to the system. The demo environment has an LDAP configured, so you will import user from the LDAP.
   
5. Open the humburger **Menu** and select **Administer -> Identity and Access**

   ![](images/2020-10-02-14-18-53.png)
   
6. Select **Teams** tab and then click on the **operations** team

   ![](images/2020-10-02-14-20-56.png)

   ![](images/2020-10-02-14-21-24.png)

7. Select the **Users** tab (1) , and then click **Add users** (2)

   ![](images/2020-10-02-14-23-21.png)

8. In the **Select domain** dropdown pick **my_ldap**. This dropdown shows all identity sources registered in the Cloud Pak. In this environment, there are two sources available: a default Openshift authentication (Cloud Identity Directory) and LDAP connection my_ldap.

   ![](images/2020-10-02-14-26-15.png)

9. In the search box, enter **carlos** and hit Enter (1). Then, select the user **carlos** (2), change the role to **Editor** (3), and finally click **Add** button (4).

   ![](images/2020-10-02-14-29-23.png)

10. Now, go back to the Monitoring UI (Menu-> Monitor health-> Incidents-> Administration -> Users and Groups). You should see user `carlos` in the list with the role `Operations engineer`. This is default mapping of Cloud Pak role `Editor` to the Monitoring module roles. Click **Groups** tab

   ![](images/2020-10-02-13-59-16.png)
 
11.	There are no groups defines so you need to create one. Click **New group**.

12. Provide the name **Online Banking Support** (1), then click Users icon (2), select user **carlos** (3) and click **Assign**

    ![](images/2020-10-02-14-41-30.png)
  
13.	Finally, click **Save**

    ![](images/2020-10-02-14-43-12.png)

    Now, when you have the right support group defined, let's configure which incidents should be assigned to this group and how the users should be notified.

***

## Configure Slack integration

Operation teams use different notification methods. Some prefer emails, but many uses collaboration tools like PagerDuty, Slack or Microsoft Teams. In this exercise you will configure integration with Slack.

1. Go back to the **Administration** view.

    ![](images/2020-10-02-14-48-36.png)

2. Select **Integrations** tile

   ![](images/2020-10-02-15-10-44.png)

3. On the Integrations view, select **Outgoing** tab (1) and then click **New integration** (2)

   ![](images/2020-10-02-15-12-56.png)

4. You can see multiple default integartions provided by Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management. If your company is not using any of the pre-defined ones, you can use the Generic webhook. In this exercise you will configure Slack so select **Slack** tile.

   ![](images/2020-10-02-15-15-10.png)

5. Provide the integration name (e.g. **slack**) (1) and then the webhook created in the Slack channel (2). For convenience, we have created a slack channel for you so you can reuse the following webhook URL:

   ```sh
   https://hooks.slack.com/services/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
   ```

   Finally click **Save** (3) to create the integration.

   ![](images/2020-10-02-15-21-26.png)

6. Now, go back to the Incoming integrations tab. You can see that along with the configured integrations, there is an additional tile for generating **Sample events**.
 
   Sample events are artificial events that are injected into the system to demonstrate some capabilities but are also very helpful for testing policies and runbook automation. Click **Generate**. 
   If you wait for about a minute you should see the following notification.
 
If you cannot see the notification or see an error, follow the tutorial as the events were probably generated anyway.
