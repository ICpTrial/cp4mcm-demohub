## Lab Overview

  IBM Cloud Pak® for Multicloud Management – Infrastructure Management delivers the insight, control, and automation enterprises need to address the challenges of managing virtual environments, which are far more complex than physical ones. This technology enables enterprises with existing virtual infrastructures to improve visibility and control, and those just starting virtualization deployments to build and operate a well-managed virtual infrastructure.

  IBM Cloud Pak® for Multicloud Management – Infrastructure Management was previously called IBM Red Hat CloudForms. For more information, see the previous versions of CloudForms® Red Hat CloudForms product documentation Opens in a new tab.

  IBM Cloud Pak® for Multicloud Management – Infrastructure Management includes the following feature sets:
  - Insight: discovery, monitoring, utilization, performance, reporting, analytics, chargeback, and trending.
  - Control: security, compliance, alerting, policy-based resource and configuration management.
  - Automate: IT process, task and event, provisioning, workload management and orchestration.
  - Integrate: systems management, tools and processes, event consoles, CMDB, RBA, and web services.

In this tutorial, you will explore the following key capabilities:
-	`Understand Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management Infrastructure Management capabilities`
-	`Learn how to define a new service for VM provisioning`
- `Learn how to provision new VM service`
-	`Learn how to apply configuration and control policies to the managed VMs`

***

## Prerequisite

- You need to provision your own copy of the CP4MCM 2.0 environment, start it and verify for correct startup (check [here](../../gettingstarted/)).

***

## Business Context



You will complete the following tasks:
-	Define a connection to Vmware vSphere environment
-	Import the provisioning template
-	Define a new service for VM provisioning
- Provision new service instance
-	Defina and apply compliance policy for a new VM service
-	Define a chargeback report for VMs

***

## Define a connection to Vmware vSphere environment

In this section, you will define a connection to the Vmware vSphere environment. The demo environment contains a single node vSphere cluster managed by the Vmware vCenter which you will leverage in that excercise.

1. To start the lab, you should be in your Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management Web Console. If you are not, check [here](../gettingstarted/) how to open your console page.

2. Now, let's explore the Infrastructure Management view. Click the hamburger **Menu** (1) and select **Automate Infrastructure -> Infrastructure Management** (2).

3. The new browser tab opens, and because there is a Single-Sign-On configured between the Cloud Pak Core and Infrastructure management module, you should get automatically logged in.

   The dashboard shows summary of the information regarding the connected providers. In this environment, there is only 1 provider used - Vmware vSphere, but you could connect many other target environments - including Openstack, Microsoft SC VMM or public clouds, like AWS, Azure, GKE, etc. This user interface was inherited from the former Red Hat CloudForms and is a commercial, supported version of the open source project ManagedIQ. This modules uses Ansible to discover the VMs in the managed providers and apply configuration and control policies. It also collects the usage data needed for chargeback reports, allowing you to divide costs of shared infrastructure among different consumers - application owners, business units or departaments.

4. To leverage Infrastructure-as-Code for service provisionig Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management uses the Terraform. To open the Terraform management UI (former Cloud Automation Manager) go back to the browser tab with the main Cloud Pak UI, click the hamburger **Menu** (1) and select **Automate Infrastructure -> Manage Services** (2).

  This opens a service management UI - where you can define and manage Terraform templates and services. Service comprise of one or more templates connected into a provisioning workflow with pre-defined parameters and service plans.

 tbc.

  Great, you connected Infrastructure management to your target environment. Let's move to the next section.
